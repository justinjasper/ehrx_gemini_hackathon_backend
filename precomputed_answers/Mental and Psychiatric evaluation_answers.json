Identified the examiner as a doctor only after being prompted.\n  - **Place:** Disoriented. Unable to identify he was in a hospital clinic and forgot moments after being told. Stated his flat was in Bedok when it is in Jurong.\n  - **Time:** Disoriented. Stated the date was 10 February (actual: 20 June), the day was Wednesday (actual: Monday), and the time was 5pm (actual: 3pm). He could not state the year and was unable to tell time from a watch.\n\n- **Memory:**\n  - Could not remember the doctor's name despite a 5-year history.\n  - Demonstrated poor short-term retention, forgetting the location and date moments after being told.\n\n- **Cognition and Fund of Knowledge:**\n  - **Basic Information:** Stated his age as 50 (actual: 55), could not recall his birthday, and incorrectly named the Prime Minister.\n  - **Arithmetic:** Unable to perform simple calculations (4+3=8, could not subtract 7 from 10) and could not count backwards from 20 to 1.\n  - **Financial:** Unable to recognize currency correctly (identified a 50-cent coin as 20 cents and a $10 note as $2).\n\n- **Insight:** Poor insight into his medical condition.
