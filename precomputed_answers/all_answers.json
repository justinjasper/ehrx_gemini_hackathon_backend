              "content": "Assessment: The patient has a personal history of autoimmune disease and a positive HLA genotype. He was diagnosed with Rheumatoid arthritis 2 months ago. His presenting symptom of bilateral joint pain in the knees and fingers paired with a positive RF, CCP, and decreased CD4 count made this diagnosis very likely. Sj\u00f6grens Syndrome is very heavily associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis, estimated prevalence between 17-30% in those with previously diagnosed Rheumatoid Arthritis. The patient's laboratory and imaging studies, including a positive SS-A, neck CT showing chronic enlargement of the Parotid Gland, paired with the symptom of dry mouth and a burning sensation of the eye, a possible manifestation of dry eyes, are suggestive of Sj\u00f6grens Syndrome. Another possible cause of the burning sensation is trigeminal neuralgia, a neurological manifestation of Sjogren's syndrome. However, this patient also presents with some of rarer manifestations of Sj\u00f6grens Syndrome. According to UpToDate: Clinical manifestations of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome: Extraglandular disease, normochromic normocytic anemia can be seen in up to 20% of sjogrens patients. Further, \b\bPatients with SS may exhibit abnormal counts in any cell line, and patients with cytopenia often have involvement of more than one cell line\b\b3. This hematologic manifestation of disease accounts for many of the abnormal blood tests including the anemia and leukopenia. This anemia could be the underlying cause of the lightheadedness and muscle weakness. Further, a more rare manifestation of Sj\u00f6grens Syndrome, is autonomic neuropathy3. Autonomic neuropathy manifests as headache, lightheadedness, early satiety, vomiting, weight loss, and sweating abnormalities. The patient's headaches with lightheadedness, as well as his GI symptoms and night sweats can be explained by the neurological manifestations of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. Finally, autoimmune diseases are often associated with cutaneous manifestations. Some of these, such as the malar rash of lupus are well defined, while others are ill defined. The pre-auricular rash can be seen as an atypical cutaneous presentation of Sjogren's syndrome.",

              "content": "Assessment: The patient has a personal history of autoimmune disease and a positive HLA genotype. He was diagnosed with Rheumatoid arthritis 2 months ago. His presenting symptom of bilateral joint pain in the knees and fingers paired with a positive RF, CCP, and decreased CD4 count made this diagnosis very likely. Sj\u00f6grens Syndrome is very heavily associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis, estimated prevalence between 17-30% in those with previously diagnosed Rheumatoid Arthritis. The patient's laboratory and imaging studies, including a positive SS-A, neck CT showing chronic enlargement of the Parotid Gland, paired with the symptom of dry mouth and a burning sensation of the eye, a possible manifestation of dry eyes, are suggestive of Sj\u00f6grens Syndrome. Another possible cause of the burning sensation is trigeminal neuralgia, a neurological manifestation of Sjogren's syndrome. However, this patient also presents with some of rarer manifestations of Sj\u00f6grens Syndrome. According to UpToDate: Clinical manifestations of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome: Extraglandular disease, normochromic normocytic anemia can be seen in up to 20% of sjogrens patients. Further, \u201cPatients with SS may exhibit abnormal counts in any cell line, and patients with cytopenia often have involvement of more than one cell line\u201d3. This hematologic manifestation of disease accounts for many of the abnormal blood tests including the anemia and leukopenia. This anemia could be the underlying cause of the lightheadedness and muscle weakness. Further, a more rare manifestation of Sj\u00f6grens Syndrome, is autonomic neuropathy3. Autonomic neuropathy manifests as headache, lightheadedness, early satiety, vomiting, weight loss, and sweating abnormalities. The patient's headaches with lightheadedness, as well as his GI symptoms and night sweats can be explained by the neurological manifestations of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. Finally, autoimmune diseases are often associated with cutaneous manifestations. Some of these, such as the malar rash of lupus are well defined, while others are ill defined. The pre-auricular rash can be seen as an atypical cutaneous presentation of Sjogren's syndrome.",

His presenting symptom of bilateral joint pain in the knees and fingers paired with a positive RF, CCP, and decreased CD4 count made this diagnosis very likely. Sj\u00f6grens Syndrome is very heavily associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis, estimated prevalence between 17-30% in those with previously diagnosed Rheumatoid Arthritis. The patient's laboratory and imaging studies, including a positive SS-A, neck CT showing chronic enlargement of the Parotid Gland, paired with the symptom of dry mouth and a burning sensation of the eye, a possible manifestation of dry eyes, are suggestive of Sj\u00f6grens Syndrome. Another possible cause of the burning sensation is trigeminal neuralgia, a neurological manifestation of Sjogren's syndrome. However, this patient also presents with some of rarer manifestations of Sj\u00f6grens Syndrome. According to UpToDate: Clinical manifestations of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome: Extraglandular disease, normochromic normocytic anemia can be seen in up to 20% of sjogrens patients. Further, \u201cPatients with SS may exhibit abnormal counts in any cell line, and patients with cytopenia often have involvement of more than one cell line\u201d3. This hematologic manifestation of disease accounts for many of the abnormal blood tests including the anemia and leukopenia. This anemia could be the underlying cause of the lightheadedness and muscle weakness. Further, a more rare manifestation of Sj\u00f6grens Syndrome, is autonomic neuropathy3. Autonomic neuropathy manifests as headache, lightheadedness, early satiety, vomiting, weight loss, and sweating abnormalities. The patient's headaches with lightheadedness, as well as his GI symptoms and night sweats can be explained by the neurological manifestations of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. Finally, autoimmune diseases are often associated with cutaneous manifestations. Some of these, such as the malar rash of lupus are well defined, while others are ill defined. The pre-auricular rash can be seen as an atypical cutaneous presentation of Sjogren's syndrome.",

        "answer": {
          "answer_summary": "The mental status examination was conducted on 20 June 2015. The findings are as follows:\n\n- **Mood and Affect:** Mood was euthymic (normal), and he had no psychotic symptoms.\n\n- **Orientation:**\n  - **Person:** Oriented to self and his son. Identified the examiner as a doctor only after being prompted.\n  - **Place:** Disoriented. Unable to identify he was in a hospital clinic and forgot moments after being told. Stated his flat was in Bedok when it is in Jurong.\n  - **Time:** Disoriented. Stated the date was 10 February (actual: 20 June), the day was Wednesday (actual: Monday), and the time was 5pm (actual: 3pm). He could not state the year and was unable to tell time from a watch.\n\n- **Memory:**\n  - Could not remember the doctor's name despite a 5-year history.\n  - Demonstrated poor short-term retention, forgetting the location and date moments after being told.\n\n- **Cognition and Fund of Knowledge:**\n  - **Basic Information:** Stated his age as 50 (actual: 55), could not recall his birthday, and incorrectly named the Prime Minister.\n  - **Arithmetic:** Unable to perform simple calculations (4+3=8, could not subtract 7 from 10) and could not count backwards from 20 to 1.\n  - **Financial:** Unable to recognize currency correctly (identified a 50-cent coin as 20 cents and a $10 note as $2).\n\n- **Insight:** Poor insight into his medical condition. He did not know his medical problems, the reason for prior hospitalization, or if he was taking any medication.",
