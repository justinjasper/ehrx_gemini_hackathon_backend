Colonoscopy revealed multiple diverticuli. Since then her stool has been brown and consistently hematest negative when checked in clinic. Several months after this admission she was noted to be mildly jaundiced and had elevated liver enzymes, at this time it was realized that she contracted hepatitis B from the transfusions.
